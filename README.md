# Compare_AD_and_Cloud_Anchors

This script will compare Local AD to Azure/Entra AD Anchors.

Every user has a behind-the-scenes "anchor" or attribute that identifies their account. Much like a thumbprint or retina would. Because situations can arise where a user might have two accounts -- one on-prem and one online -- that do not link together, this is how you identify it.
<br>
The script below is just the beginning pieces. It's very important you follow the general workflow as described in the ticket (and screenshot below if you don't have ticket access).
<br><br>
Replace the code below with required information.

<br><br>
`$username    = "ALIAS_GOES_HERE"  #like jsmith`<br>
`$wholename = "FULL_NAME_GOES_HERE" #like "John Smith"`
